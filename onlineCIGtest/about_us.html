				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					This website is a working model of the research we are conducting at Texas Tech University as part of our exploration of 
					declarative programming and its applications for increasing the accessibility of Clinical Practice Guidelines and potential 
					comorbidities. It is developed to accurately intake patient information and output a streamlined list of medications that complies
					with the diseases’ clinical practice guidelines.

					It is estimated that over 98,000 preventable deaths occur every year due to medical errors. With such 
					high numbers, it is becoming ever more important to find methods to reduce mortality and aid doctors in 
					eliminating errors. One of the established approaches is the creation of evidence based clinical practice 
					guidelines to help standardize and improve the quality of medical care patients receive. However, the 
					information heavy nature and inconvenient format of clinical practice guidelines are major obstacles in 
					the eventual goal of widespread usability. These guidelines are often in the form of a lengthy article and 
					reading them all is an impossibility for doctors with already numerous time constraints. For these reasons, 
					clinical practice guidelines cannot fulfill its full potential to aid in mortality and mistake reduction. 
					In addition to the accessibility problems, the biggest challenge doctors face is that these clinical 
					practice guidelines present lots of redundancies and interactions when applied to patients with multiple 
					diseases. Because they are not adapted for patients with comorbidities, it becomes very difficult for 
					physicians to follow these guidelines. Having an automated system would result in an increase in accessibility 
					and the production of a tool doctors can utilize to better apply clinical practice guidelines for comorbidities. 
					Thus, our research focuses on a solution for this problem by exploring the potential declarative programming has 
					in maximizing both the accessibility and automation of clinical practice guidelines. Declarative languages 
					distinguish themselves from other languages as prime candidates for this purpose because of the ease with which 
					English sentences and ideas can be translated into functional code. This ability of declarative programming to 
					facilitate direct translation makes it an excellent tool in the creation of a complex program full of complicated 
					medical jargon and interactions. In addition, we intended to exploit the non-monotonicity of declarative programming 
					to add critical flexibility to our sample program. In our research, the specific declarative language we have chosen 
					to explore and test is answer set prolog. Through this project, we embark on an exploration of the role answer set 
					programming could play in promoting increased and more thorough usage of clinical practice guidelines.
